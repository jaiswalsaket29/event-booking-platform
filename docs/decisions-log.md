# Decisions log

One short entry per feature, newest at the bottom. This file is for interview prep, so each entry answers: what was built, why it was built that way, and the main alternative and trade-off. Keep each entry under about 10 lines.

Template:

```
## <Feature> (<date>, <commit>)
- What: ...
- Why this way: ...
- Alternative considered: ... (trade-off: ...)
- Interview hook: one sentence you'd say if asked about it.
```

## Refresh tokens (Day 8)
- What: opaque 64-byte random refresh tokens, stored as SHA-256 hashes in `refresh_tokens`, 30-day expiry, rotated on every `/auth/refresh`, revoked on `/auth/logout`.
- Why this way: a DB-backed token makes logout and revocation real, whereas a JWT alone stays valid until it expires. Hashing means a DB leak doesn't hand out usable tokens. Rotation limits how long a stolen token is useful.
- Alternative considered: a long-lived JWT refresh token (trade-off: no server-side revocation) and an httpOnly cookie (trade-off: better XSS protection but needs CSRF handling; possible later upgrade).
- Interview hook: "Access tokens are stateless for speed; refresh tokens are stateful so I can revoke them."
